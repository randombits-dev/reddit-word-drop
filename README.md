# Word Drop (reddit app)

A word game where you find words within a letter grid. When you complete a word, the letters above it fall, to make new combinations. Bigger words score more points, and the highest scores are shown on a leaderboard.

Each word game can be created with a 4x4, 5x5, 6x6, 7x7, or 8x8 grid, and the letters are randomly generated, based on a distribution graph, so vowels and common letters appear more often.

To create a single puzzle post, use the "Create Word Drop Puzzle" option in the subreddit menu. To create automatic daily puzzles, use the "Manage Word Drop Automation" option in the subreddit menu. The automatic puzzles can be setup to be created at a specific time each day, and you can choose which grid sizes to use.
